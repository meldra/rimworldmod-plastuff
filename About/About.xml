    <description>After some research your colonists learn that combining chemfuel with rice creates a durable resin they dubbed plastuff.

Plastuff can be sculpted for art, structures and floors, and crucially when combined with cloth it creates a range of synthetic textiles; a more pleatherable clothing experience for animal lovers.

This mod introduces a pathway for crafting fur-like and leather-like fabrics which don't involve slaughtering creatures, and fills a gap between cloth and expensive non-craftable fabrics. It allows for creating a range of advanced textiles when you only have hydroponic growing available.

Plastuff should be safe to add to an existing game, and shouldn't require other mods but there are a few around that'll help with gaining the necessary resources.
